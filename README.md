## Description
#### This snake game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML was used to create the layout of how this game looks. CSS was used to style it. Gave a background using CSS and CSS grid was used to the canvas to give it some columns and rows. I used JavaScript to write the game logics. Whenever the snake eats it's food it's length increments and you lose the game if you hit the border or hit yourself.
